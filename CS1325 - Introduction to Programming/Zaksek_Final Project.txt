INSTRUCTIONS

The program runs like any other .c file. Simply run it in any C compiler, and on-screen instructions
will guide you through opening the text file that contains the word search.

Be sure the text file you want to use is saved on your computer, and that you also know its full path.
That information will be requested by the program.
