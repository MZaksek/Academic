# Academic
This repository contains a select collection of academic projects, which involve a substantial amount of coding.

# CS1325 - Introduction to Programming
Contains an individual final project, written in C, in which the program inputs a crossword from a text file and verifies whether or not an inputted string is contained within the crossword in any direction, and if so, how many times.

# MECH3315 - Fluid Mechanics
Contains a group final project in which we use MATLAB to analyze experimental data collected from a wind tunnel trial.

# MECH6318 - Engineering Optimization
Another group final project, in which we develop an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm using MATLAB to optimize a route that an autonomous delivery bot can take to minimize overall travel distance when visiting a set of locations on The University of Texas at Dallas campus.

# MECH6339 - Multidisciplinary Design Optimization
An individual project, using MATLAB, which incorporates a surrogate model derived from high-fidelity FEA simulations, used to optimize the wall thickness of a diving cylinder.
